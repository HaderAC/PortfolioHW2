Create the following files files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

A navbar

A responsive layout

Responsive images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

Screenshots are provided as a reference in the Assets/Images folder. Your app does not need to be exactly like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

Functional, deployed application

GitHub repository with README describing the project

Navbar must be consistent on each page.

Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

All links must work.

Must use semantic html.

Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

Created a portfolio site with three pages that lonk to each other, I used mostly bootstrap elemts to create the page and added some css to edit out elemts some more. I was able to find some additional javascript code to allowme to have the buttons react to the features i was trying to display. Asthetically i prefer the minimalism of it.
